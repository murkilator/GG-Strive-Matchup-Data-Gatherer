"# GG-Strive-Matchup-Data-Gatherer" 

This program creates a spreadsheet of character matchup data by analyzing replays within the GGST replay menu. It works by reading the screen and matching the appropriate sections of the screen with the template images found in the templates folder.

To run, start GGST and go to the replay menu. Set the filter to your choosing (lowest floor/highest floor, chars, etc), then run this script. This script currently assumes 2560x1440 resolution
